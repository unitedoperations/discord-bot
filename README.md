### Discord

Permissions for the bot should be configured as:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gjWLIRH.png" />

The _"Permissions Integer"_ at the bottom is the value for the environment variable `BOT_PERMISSIONS`.

1. In the _"OAuth2"_ tab of the developer portal, give the application **_only_** the `bot` scope, then configure with the permission set above.

2. Copy and paste the generated OAuth2 URL into the browser and select the Discord server to give access to the bot to join.

3. Insert all sensitive authentication data into the environment variables file from the developer portal.

4. You can copy the IDs of the server and channels by right clicking on them while in Discord's _Developer Mode_, and place them with the appropriate environment variables in the `.env` file

5. Go into the Discord server options, `Server Settings > Roles`, and ensure the that the role for the bot is placed above _all_ other roles in the list

6. If the `ARMA_CHANNEL`, `BMS_CHANNEL`, or `MAIN_CHANNEL` are locked, make sure to give special permission to the bot's role for the channel:

   - Read Messages
   - Send Messages
   - Send TTS Messages
   - Manage Messages
   - Embed Links

7. Once the `Node.js` application is running, the bot will appear as _"Online"_ on the Discord server and ready to handle requests
